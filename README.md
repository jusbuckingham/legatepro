**LegatePro is a modern, role‑aware probate management platform with built‑in estate intelligence.**

It replaces fragmented spreadsheets, PDFs, and email threads with a single, court‑aware system that answers four questions in real time:

> **What’s complete. What’s missing. What’s at risk. What happens next.**

Built for Personal Representatives (executors), probate attorneys, and fiduciaries who require precision, auditability, and confidence during legally complex proceedings.

LegatePro uses AI as **decision support**, not automation theater.

AI enhances judgment — it never replaces it.
